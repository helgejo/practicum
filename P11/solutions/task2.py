# PageRank computation
# ====================

# Task
# ------

#  - Compute the PageRank scores for the given web graph.
#  - The graph contains rank sinks (pages with no outlinks) -- deal with them!
#  - Use q=0.15

# Solution
# --------

# (This is the graph from Task 2 of the exercise 20151103-Lecture-10-PageRank)

Practicum 11
============

Learning objectives:

  - Understanding Language Modeling scoring
  - Implementing PageRank


## Task 0. Exercises with LM scoring

  - See itslearning: 20151106-Practicum-11-LM
  

## Task 1. PageRank computation

  - Compute the PageRank scores for the given web graph.
  - We assume that there are no rank sinks (pages with no outlinks).
  - Use q=0.5
  
  
## Task 2. PageRank computation
  
  - Compute the PageRank scores for the given web graph.
  - The graph contains rank sinks (pages with no outlinks) -- deal with them!
  - Use q=0.15
